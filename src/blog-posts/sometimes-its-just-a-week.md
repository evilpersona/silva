Sometimes a week is just a week, you continue that grind, been streaming a lot more on Twitch and on YouTube.  Learning a bit more about myself when I stream, and how focused I get.  You zone out to that chat and just vibe.  It has been a bit therapeutic, worked on some characters and realized how off some of the characters are, and I want to get them all on model.  It's funny though that you only draw a character from one side all of the time, that you have no idea what the other side of their face looks like.\

Next week, I'll be getting back to cleaning up some more boards, I do want to get them pretty tight, and there is one scene that I just don't know about, especially how to make it look right.  So I'll be working on that as well.\

Enjoy have a good weekend!  You can check out the new shirt up in the shop!
