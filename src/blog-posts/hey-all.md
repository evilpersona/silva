Welcome to the new ChristopherSilva.com!

It's been pretty busy around here. Currently working on another version of Rumsfeld3d that I am actually proud of as it is my own story. But I can't share any of that and I want to be able to get some content out to you.

So here I will be selling clothing as well as some prints.

My social media accounts will be used for sketches and unfinished work, and all new work will be here.
