From October to February I took the Animation Bootcamp Class with Ethan Becker, and I must say it was fantastic.  What the class teaches you are the essentials to what you need to learn to make your own short.\
\
This is what I really needed, as it gave me some deadlines in order to complete everything that I needed to complete.  The short ended up being around 6-7 minutes, but it isn't ready to be presented.  For now, I will put on finishing touches and making it pretty.\
\
There are some other scenes and gags to be done.  In the mean time I'll continue making the shirts.  Last week was rough because I didn't expect all the crunch so... no shirt, so this week I made two!\

If there are other things that you want or products and things I should put up let me know!
